# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio, showcasing my projects in machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis. This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

## About
This portfolio highlights my work in data science, including predictive modeling, natural language processing, and interactive dashboards. Explore the projects to see how I use Python, R, SQL, and various tools to solve real-world problems.

## Setup
To run this site locally:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Push `index.html` to the `main` branch.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings under the "Pages" section, selecting the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.

## Customization
- Update `index.html` with your personal details (e.g., name, email, GitHub/LinkedIn links).
- Replace project links and descriptions with your own projects.
- Add images to the `images/` folder and reference them in the project cards.
